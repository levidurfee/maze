# maze solver

[![build v0.8.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-0.1.0-red.svg)]()

This project still needs work. View the [demo](https://levi.lol/maze/).

## todo

- [ ] [#1](https://github.com/levidurfee/maze/issues/1) Remove unused properties (it got messy)
- [ ] [#2](https://github.com/levidurfee/maze/issues/2) Add moveUp method (none of my test mazes needed to move up)
- [ ] [#3](https://github.com/levidurfee/maze/issues/3) Keep track of successes and fails
- [ ] [#4](https://github.com/levidurfee/maze/issues/4) PHPUnit testing / TravisCI
- [ ] [#5](https://github.com/levidurfee/maze/issues/5) Remove my tracking code ;)

## notes

Some of the methods are protected, but they really don't need to be. Probably make them public for unit testing.
